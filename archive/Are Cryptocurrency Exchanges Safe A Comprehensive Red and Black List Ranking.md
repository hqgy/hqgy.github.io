## Blacklisted Exchanges: Security Failures  

### 1. Mt. Gox (2014)  
**Event**: The collapse of Mt. Gox, once handling 70% of global Bitcoin transactions, resulted in the theft of **850,000 BTC** (worth over $50 billion today).  
**Cause**: Centralized storage of private keys allowed hackers to exploit single points of failure.  
**Lesson**: Decentralized key management and cold storage are essential for protecting user funds.  

### 2. Coincheck (2018)  
**Event**: Hackers stole **$534 million in NEM tokens** from Japan's Coincheck.  
**Cause**: Poor security practices, including reliance on hot wallets without multi-signature protection, enabled unauthorized access.  
**Lesson**: Cold storage implementation and regular security audits could have prevented this breach.  

### 3. Bitfinex (2016 & 2022)  
**Dual Breaches**:  
- **2016**: $72 million in Bitcoin stolen due to compromised multi-signature wallets.  
- **2022**: $200 million lost through a cross-chain bridge vulnerability.  
**Controversy**: The platform's use of proprietary tokens (LEO) to compensate users raised transparency concerns.  

### 4. Smaller Exchanges  
**2023 Incident**: A third-tier exchange lost funds through collusion between insiders and hackers.  
**Risks**: Smaller platforms often lack rigorous security protocols, making them prime targets for both external attacks and internal fraud.
