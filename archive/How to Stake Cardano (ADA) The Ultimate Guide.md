## What Is Cardano (ADA) Staking?  

Cardano staking involves locking up ADA tokens to support the network's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, **Ouroboros**. By participating in staking, users validate transactions and earn rewards in return.  

### Key Components of Cardano Staking  
- **Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Manage nodes that validate transactions.  
- **Delegators:** Stake ADA in pools without running nodes.  
- **Epochs:** Reward cycles lasting 5 days, with payouts calculated based on balances from 25 days prior.

### How Staking Differs From Lending  
While staking focuses on blockchain security, **lending ADA** through DeFi or CeFi platforms provides liquidity for trading activities. Lending often yields higher returns but carries greater risks.
