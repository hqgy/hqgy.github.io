## Participating in Axie Infinity Gameplay  

The core attraction of AXS lies in its integration with Axie Infinity, a play-to-earn blockchain game. Players can earn AXS through three primary gameplay mechanics:

Completing daily quests (e.g., winning specific numbers of battles) and achieving milestones (e.g., breeding 10 Axies) unlocks AXS rewards.

## Staking AXS for Passive Income  

Staking AXS secures the Axie Infinity network while rewarding participants. Two main staking avenues exist:

|----------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Axie Infinity  | 4â€“6%          | 100 AXS       |  
| Aave           | 3â€“5%          | 50 AXS        |  
| Yearn Finance  | 5â€“8%          | 200 AXS       |
